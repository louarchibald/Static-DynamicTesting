### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

# class CardGame:


#   def check_for_ace(self, card):
#     if card.value = 1:
#       return True
#     else
#       return False

#     # no colon after the else statement so function will not complete
   

#   dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
#   if card1.value > card2.value:
#     return card
#   else:
#     return card2
  
#   # - typo in function - should be def
#   # - missing comma between the final two parameters
#   # - if statement won't be able to return "card" as it has not been passed in (should be card1)


# def cards_total(self, cards):
#   total
#   for card in cards:
#     total += card.value
#     return "You have a total of" + total

# return statement is indented too far
  
```
